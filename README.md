# Fundamentals of Data Analytics: Assignment 1
This repository provides the source code which is used for creating and analyzing data samples for assignment 1 of Delft University of Technology's course SPM4450 Fundamentals of Data Analytics (15/16).

There are two mains:

1. CreateData-class, creates a file with data according to the implemented fw(x)-function. Adds some noise to the points as well.
2. Main-class, analyzes input points, performs polynomial regression based on those points and calculates the MSE decomposition of bias and variance per complex model.
